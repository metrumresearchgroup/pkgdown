\arguments{
\item{pkg}{Path to package.}

\item{lazy}{If \code{TRUE}, only rebuild pages where the \code{.Rd}
is more recent than the \code{.html}. This makes it much easier to
rapidly prototype. It is set to \code{FALSE} by \code{\link[=build_site]{build_site()}}.}

\item{examples}{Run examples?}

\item{run_dont_run}{Run examples that are surrounded in \\dontrun?}

\item{seed}{Seed used to initialize so that random examples are
reproducible.}

\item{override}{An optional named list used to temporarily override
values in \verb{_pkgdown.yml}}

\item{preview}{If \code{TRUE}, or \code{is.na(preview) && interactive()}, will preview
freshly generated section in browser.}

\item{devel}{Determines how code is loaded in order to run examples.
If \code{TRUE} (the default), assumes you are in a live development
environment, and loads source package with \code{\link[pkgload:load_all]{pkgload::load_all()}}.
If \code{FALSE}, uses the installed version of the package.}

\item{document}{\strong{Deprecated} Use \code{devel} instead.}

\item{topics}{Build only specified topics. If supplied, sets \verb{lazy`` and }preview\code{to}FALSE`.}
}
\description{
By default, pkgdown will generate an index that lists all functions in
alphabetical order. To override this, provide a \code{reference} section in your
\verb{_pkgdown.yml} as described below.
}
\section{YAML config}{

To tweak the index page, add a section called \code{reference} to \verb{_pkgdown.yml}
which provides a list of sections containing, a \code{title}, list of \code{contents},
and an optional \code{description}.

For example, the following code breaks up the functions in pkgdown
into two groups:\preformatted{reference:
- title: Render components
  desc:  Build each component of the site.
  contents:
  - starts_with("build_")
  - init_site
- title: Templates
  contents:
  - render_page
}

Note that \code{contents} can contain either a list of function names, or if the
functions in a section share a common prefix or suffix, you can use
\code{starts_with("prefix")} and \code{ends_with("suffix")} to select them all. For
more complex naming schemes you can use an arbitrary regular expression with
\code{matches("regexp")}. You can also use a leading \verb{-} to exclude matches from a
section. By default, these functions that match multiple topics will exclude
topics with the Rd keyword "internal". To include these, use
\code{starts_with("build_", internal = TRUE)}.

You can also select topics that contain specified Rd concepts with
\code{has_concept("blah")}.

You can provide long descriptions for groups of functions using the YAML \verb{>}
notation:\preformatted{desc: >
  This is a very long and overly flowery description of a
  single simple function.
}

If you have functions with odd names (e.g. that start with a plus symbol
\verb{+}), you can include them by double-escaping. This YAML entry adds the
\code{+.gg} function to the ggplot2 documentation:\preformatted{- "`+.gg`"
}

pkgdown will check that all non-internal topics are included on
this page, and will generate a warning if you have missed any.
}

\section{Figures}{


You can control the default rendering of figures by specifying the \code{figures}
field in \verb{_pkgdown.yml}. The default settings are equivalent to:\preformatted{figures:
  dev: grDevices::png
  dpi: 96
  dev.args: []
  fig.ext: png
  fig.width: 7.2916667
  fig.height: ~
  fig.retina: 2
  fig.asp: 1.618
}
}

\section{Icons}{

You can optionally supply an icon for each help topic. To do so, you'll need
a top-level \code{icons} directory. This should contain {.png} files that are
either 30x30 (for regular display) or 60x60 (if you want retina display).
Icons are matched to topics by aliases.
